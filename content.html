        <h1>Possibilities for the Project</h1>
        <p>From before Year 12, I realised that I had grown a deep interest in space and would love to revolve a project around it. Space would be perfect as there is a broad spectrum of topics to cover and is growing important for future generations.
            <br></br>
            This idea of content coupled with my broad use of many software to create different products allowed me to satisfy the requirements and needs for my project:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Animated Information Idea – 3D realistic animation with text displayed as it goes to each planet/object. Would utilise Blender and Adobe After Effects.</li>
            <li>Website Showcasing the Nature of Space – An informative medium for people to engagingly learn about the characteristics/ideas of space.</li>
            <li>Website About Space with Quiz – Similar to idea #2, however with a quiz that would engage the audience more.</li>
            <li>Physical Models of the Properties of the Solar System – 3D printed objects that are seen in space (planets, asteroids, blackholes, etc.) with a text tile adjacent to display the information.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>From here I was able to create concept sketches to see if these ideas would work practically and generated ways to improve upon these. With the sketches and concepts in my head, I based the decided upon the most appropriate and realistic one that I could create in order to obtain the best quality possible.
            </p>
            <h2>Project Possibility Sketches</h2>
            <div class="sketches">
                <div class="box"><img src="images/animated_video.jpg" alt="Animated Video"></div>
                <div class="box"><img src="images/website.jpg" alt="Website"></div>
                <div class="box"><img src="images/website_w_quiz.jpg" alt="Website With a Quiz"></div>
                <div class="box"><img src="images/physical_models.jpg" alt="Physical Models"></div>
            </div>
            <p>
                From these ideas I was able to figure out the one that I would like to apply myself to the most that will also be realistically achievable in the time given and with my skill set. 
                As I am aspiring to be a software engineer for my future career, I thought it important to base a project around this, thus going with the idea of an informative website, however without the quiz as it is too much work with back-end coding to not be considered as a candidate for the Software Major Project instead.
            </p>-

        <section id="exploration">
        <h1>Exploration of the Need</h1>
        <p>My proposed product will be an informative website about the characteristics and uniqueness of space. It will include the topics of: The Solar System, The Unique Universe and Our Future. These topics will provide all the necessary information while still being engaging and not boring. The website will consist of text, images and videos created through many different methods to successfully engage the audience. This website will be focused towards the target market of upper primary school students and teachers.
           <br></br>
           Therefore, the need of my product is to inform the younger generations of the characteristics of space, sparking an interest in them young so that they can continue a successful future after our generation’s demise. This is an essential need as there is rapid progression in technology towards space and younger people must have a sparked interest in the topic so that the technology and innovation continues to progress.
            </p>
        <h3>Research of the Need - Formal</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="research_column">
                After some brief research, I figured found that the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs has proven that space related topics often spark students' curiosity and imagination and encourage youth of both genders to become increasingly involved in the sciences. However, the NSW curriculum only addresses that students must “identify that Earth is part of a system of planets orbiting around a star (the Sun)”. This curriculum was/is sufficient for students similar to me, and my product must address this curriculum and have an expansion of knowledge in order to successfully satisfy the need.
                <br></br>
                I then began to research children wanting to go to space and being interesting. This led to a realization that the informing children of space was a necessity as a survey conducted by LEGO found that 86% of children are interested in space exploration and 90% more want to learn more about it. Also, there is a vast want to become an astronaut throughout the world with most coming from China with 56% of children but still being in the top 5 for UK and US with 11% which is still a large number (figure 1.1). This shows that there is a legitimate need for informing children of our universe and sparking interest in younger generations so these statistics can increase

        <section id="market_research">
        <h1>Market Research</h1>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        I conducted both primary and secondary research of the Market. The secondary research has been included because there I needed to figure out how to successfully engage the target market in order for my product to be successfully. I conducted primary research to find out what the topics of the product will be and explore the basis that my products’ need must fulfill. 
        </p>
        <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
        <p>
            The target market for this product is students and teachers of Years 5 and 6 of primary school. This broad audience will allow for me to access a large amount of people and spark an interest in as many children as possible so that they can develop into the necessary fields in the future.
            Successful engagement of the target market includes:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>use a mix of media (videos, drawing, photos etc)</li>
            <li>Let the students have control</li>
            <li>low modal language, sharp concise points</li>
            <li>not an information overboard (balance between text and other media).</li>
            <li>Simple navigation of website</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            <b>Is this being done effectively?</b>
            <br>
            Currently, along the entire spectrum of education there are many websites that successfully engage the target market of my product. However, for websites specifically for space, it is consistent that there is a confusing navigation as well as an overload of information. This causes the target audience to not be engage, thus giving a gap in the market for my product.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h2>Primary Research</h2>
        <p>
        My primary research consisted of personable interviews with teachers and a student at Newcastle East Public School and a survey for exclusively students years 5-6:
        Interviewing of Students and Teachers:
        <h3>Interview Results</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mr’s Thompson, year 6 class teacher: ‘Many of the kids are always wanting to see about space and are sometimes frightened by the scale of the universe. However, the websites I show them are too childish and cater to more year 3.”</li>
            <li>Mr McCain, principal ‘Space is always an interesting topic where there are many opportunities for a future, and I think that the students at this school would be very keen to learn about it.</li>
            <li>Student: (Yet to be done)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Survey Results</h2>
        <div class="survey">
            <div class="survey_box"><img src="images/survey_1.png" alt="Survey Question 1"></div>
            <div class="survey_box"><img src="images/survey_2.png" alt="Survey Question 2"></div>
            <div class="survey_box"><img src="images/survey_3.png" alt="Survey Question 3"></div>
            <div class="survey_box"><img src="images/survey_4.png" alt="Survey Question 4"></div>
        </div>
        <h3>Evaluation and Analysis of Results</h3>
        <p>
            Based off of the Primary and Secondary research of the Market, it is evident that many students and teachers are interested in my design. 
            <br>
            The graphs indicate that there is a need among students for space related content and I will model the topics of the product off of the results from the question “What is your favourite part of space”.
            <br>
            From secondary research, I have found that a website is suitable as long as there is a balance and constant engagement during the learning process.

        <section id="investigation">
        <h1>Areas of Investigation</h1>
        <p>
            For my Major Development Project I will conduct research into four broad key areas:
            <br></br> 
            <b>Current Solutions:</b>
            <br>
            The research into the current product is essential into gaining an understanding of what is working well and what is missing and can be added in my own design.
            <br>
            I will look upon a broad spectrum of websites under the key search ‘space websites for kids’. From here I will gain a good understanding of what can be used and what can be improved upon. An example that I will base my research around for current solute ons are the websites “NASA Hubblesite”, <a href="https://hubblesite.org/">https://hubblesite.org/</a>" and “ALMA kids”, <a href="https://kids.alma.cl/">https://kids.alma.cl/</a>
            <br></br>
            <b>Target Market Needs:</b>
            <br>
            The needs of the target market are an necessity of investigation.
            This research includes what the target audience likes, how they behave, what makes them engaged and what proves to be beneficial/works for them. This has been conducted through both secondary research on the internet and primary research of both an interview with the teachers of the target market as well as a survey of the students. This key area has been investigated thoroughly in the “Market Research” section.
            <br></br>
            <b>Accurate background information about space:</b>
            <br>
            The key subjects of important information that I want to look at for this project are closely related to the topics. This would mean that searches would consist of the planets of our solar system, The strange properties and objects of space and humanities future.
            <br>
            For the information about space, I will use a vast range of secondary sources that come from the internet. An example would be NASA websites on specific topics, <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/overview/">https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/overview/</a> and credible websites such as “Niskanen Center”, <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/humanitys-future-among-stars/">https://www.niskanencenter.org/humanitys-future-among-stars/</a>. 
            I can also use projected future plans by Elon Musk and SpaceX, <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/</a>, to gain accurate primary information about future plans relevant to my topics. 
            <br></br>
            <b>Usage of Tools/Techniques:</b>
            <br>
            Because of the need for an aesthetically pleasing product, I must use tools and techniques that result in an effective product. These tools are highlighted in the section “selection and use of resources” and are all used for high end credible products, making them extremely effective and reliable. Furthermore, these software come with certain techniques that prove to be make the product more functional and aesthetic. In Blender, this includes the “Musgrave texture”, utilising shading nodes and “mathematic” nodes for advanced outcomes and creating a landscape using the plug-in “object scatter”. For HTML and CSS, I will use animation pseudo elements a “flexbox” structuring and “grid” layout in order for a simplistic, yet effective end-product.
        </p>
        <h2>Exploration of a Designer</h2>
        <h3>Philipp Dettmer</h3>
        <p>
            Philipp Dettmer is the creator of the successful Kurzgesagt which is a German Youtube channel that informs people about interesting aspects of life, focusing on the exploration of space and how unique it is. Dettmer’s vision is to make a story out of everything and ask big questions about the world and our future in order to spark interest in individuals to push for a better, more advanced future. Dettmer’s design of Kurzgesagt is similar to my MDP as he aims to inform an audience and spark an interest in individuals as well as the content of his page is very similar to mine. I also want to ask the big questions about space; however, my product will be focused more on the younger generations, unlike Dettmer’s product which is focused for more qualified people as his concepts are explained more complex.
            <br>
            Dettmer has assisted me in the designing of my project as he has shown me what is engaging to broad audiences, unlike other website which are aimed towards academic individuals. His use of artwork and visualisation as a medium for informing is a goal that I hope to achieve to a similar level; using many mediums to convey the project.

        <h1>Criteria to Evaluate Success</h1>
        <h3>My product will be successful if it follows the following criteria:
            <br>
            This criteria of success will consist of two main parts; functionality and aesthetic: (ordered from most to least important</h3>

        </container>
        
        <h2>Appropriateness, Analysis and Evaluation of the Criteria of Success</h2>
        <p>This criteria is appropriate and the factors are important because they allow for a guideline to the product that will, if follow, guarantee the functionality and aesthetic of the product will be of a high standard, ultimately satisfying the need of the design brief and engaging the audience, getting the point across.
            <br></br>
           The evaluation of the criteria of success will be done through anonymous feedback surveys which is an honorary system that has proven to be effective and beneficial for the product. This survey will ask both broad and specific questions, directly relating to the criteria of success. 
            <br>
           This anonymous feedback surveys will take two forms, one for the students and another for teachers. The difference between these surveys is the use of language and conciseness of the questions.

            <p>As this is such a large project with a set time period I will implement many strategies that will allow me to use my abilities to the best possible. These strategies include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Effectively use of time in class.</li>
                <li>Use free time at home.</li>

                <li>Cutback on recreational activities however continue a balance.</li>
                <li>Have a more routine day that increases project work.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>The budget for this project will be $10, this is in case of there being a blender model that would be essential for the final projects that must be purchased. However, I will avoid this as much as possible and aim for a budget of $0.</p>

        <section id="summary">
        <h1>Summary/Evaluation</h1>
        <p>In this proposal for my Multimedia MDP, I have fairly effectively taken in to consideration all aspects and factors that will come during the production of the project. All resources, tools and techniques have been thoroughly addressed (Selection and Use of Resources),
            I have created a proposed timeline (Gantt Chart) of when sub-projects must be completed and explained what each of these sub-projects requires to be adequately completed (Action Plan). Furthermore, the in-depth researching (Areas of Investigation) that I have 
            conducted includes finding credible websites and images as well as the pre-existing solutions, resources that I can use and their techniques and a designer similar to me that has been successful. This researching has given me a perfect understanding of what is 
            to be required throughout my MDP. Furthermore, my ideation and creativity while creating possible product ideas (Possibilities for the Project) has to output a real solution to the need that I have proved to be applicable to the real world through extensive exploration (Exploration of the Need). 
            I have also somewhat recognized all limitations that can affect me and provided solutions, but there are most likely more (Limitations) and created a criteria of success that only addresses some of the functional and aesthetics criteria provided to make the product of good quality.
            Finally, I believe the target market of young students and teachers (Market Research) has been effectively addressed through both secondary and primary research which has proven that this market is the best to base the product around.
